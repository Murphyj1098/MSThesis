In this thesis, network emulation is presented as a solution to testing, developing, and extending communication systems in a time- and cost-effective manner.
Complex hybrid and dynamic wireless networks require extensive testing that is not easily conducted in hardware testbeds and may not be modeled accurately enough in network simulation tools.
Network emulation provides the benefits of both hardware testbeds and simulation tools while also minimizing the shortcomings of each.
This thesis evaluates the Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator (EMANE) as a network emulation tool by assessing its ability to emulate several complex network models.
These models include hybrid wireless rural broadband deployments, an intelligent routing software development environment, and dynamic robot swarm networks.
The emulated models were determined to be accurate enough to their hardware counterparts such that EMANE can be used as an effective tool for prototyping and testing communication systems.
