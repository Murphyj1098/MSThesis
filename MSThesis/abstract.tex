As networks and the Internet become more important for work and entertainment and stuff, research into testing new network technologies and topologies continues to grow. % Better motivation wording
This testing can be expensive and time-consuming to do via hardware and so many simulation tools have been created to allow for initial testing without the need for expensive hardware and time-consuming setup.

This thesis examines one such tool, the Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator (EMANE).
This open-source tool can be used to allow for accurate testing of wireless networks by emulating key characteristics of a wireless communication system.

This thesis outlined three separate use-cases for EMANE, testing rural broadband deployment topologies, developing and testing new networking software and hardware, and integrating with other simulation tools to enhance communication accuracy.
