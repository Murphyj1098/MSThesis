\chapter{Hybrid Wireless Rural Broadband Networks}
\label{chapter3}
The first testing scenario EMANE was used for was emulating two wireless, hybrid network topologies that were designed to more effectively deliver broadband to small rural communities.
The important factors to emulate

\section{What was implemented?}
    % Hardware testbed utilized a mmWave backhaul and Ubiquiti LTU radios for the distribution network
    % mmWave and LTU were abstracted using rfPipe in EMANE
    % Allowed for testing throughput and bandwidth characteristics with multiple hosts connected as well as range using simple pathloss models

\subsection{OVERCOME Testbed}
    % Topology
        % (FIGURE\_OVERCOMETopology)
        % Two sets of mmWave backhauls
        % Aggregate at a router in the middle of town
        % Split into 3 radios for distribution to ~30 houses

    % Technologies used
        % Ubiquiti AirFiber, Ubiquiti Edge Switches, Netgate pfSense Router, Ubiquiti LTU Rockets
        % (turns into)
        % mmWave rfPipe model, virtual bridge acting as a switch, virtualized pfSense router in VirtualBox, LTU rfPipe model

\subsection{ZoomTEL Testbed}
    % Topology
        % (FIGURE\_ZoomTELTopology)
        % Two-hop mmWave backhaul
        % LTE-U distribution network at each hop
        % Distribute to hosts centered around each hop

    % Technologies used
        % Siklu EtherHaul, Ubiquiti network switches, Ubiquiti LTU Rockets
        % (turns into_
        % mmWave rfPipe model, virtual bridge acting as a switch, LTU rfPipe model


\section{How was it implemented?}
    % Creating mmWave and LTU in EMANE
        % Use rfPipe to mimic characteristics of mmWave and LTU
            % Bandwidth, delay, throughput, frequency of interest, distance between radios, antenna RX and TX gains

    % Interfacing with a real pfSense router in EMANE
        % Use EMANE transport plugins to delivery and receive real TCP/IP packets from a virtualized router
        % Performance implications of using a virtualized router vs. the real hardware router?
            % (No, there was such limited traffic that the hardware router was never pushed beyond a few percent usage, and the virtual router never bottlenecked)

    % How were things like throughput and latency tested?
        % In EMANE?
            % Tools like iperf3 were used for generating traffic
            % Test probes in EMANE were used for monitoring the "behavior" of the physical channel
        % In the hardware testbed?
            % Ookla's speed test was used for collecting data through homes
            % pfSense router monitored and recorded total data usage via the "bandwidthD" utility
            % iftop was used (as apart of the intelligent router) and recorded average bandwidth usage during certain testing periods


\section{Why was it implemented this way?}
    % What were the important features to capture in EMANE
        % Throughput
        % Latency
        % Estimated pathloss (and packet loss) over expected hardware distances
        % Anything else?


\section{Compare EMANE results to real testbed?}
    % How similar are the results from EMANE to the heardware testbed?
