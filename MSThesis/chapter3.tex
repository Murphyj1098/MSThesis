\label{chapter3}

    % System was designed as an easily implementable, low-cost 

\section{What was implemented?}
    % Similarities in each of the two test-beds

\subsection{OVERCOME Test-bed}
    % Topology
    % Technologies used

\subsection{ZoomTEL Test-bed}
    % Topology
    % Technologies used

\section{How was it implemented?}
    % Creating mmWave and LTU in EMANE
    % Interfacing with a real pfSense router in EMANE

\section{Why was it implemented this way?}
    % What were the important features to capture in EMANE
        % Throughput
        % Latency
        % Anything else?

\section{Compare EMANE results to real test-bed?}
    % Are the measured throughputs and latencies the same IRL and in EMANE?
    % (Do I have this data?)
