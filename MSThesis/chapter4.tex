\chapter{Intelligent Router}
\label{chapter4}

    % Broadband in rural situations is limited due to reasons explained in Chapter 3
    % Utilizes the OVERCOME test-bed from Chapter 3

\section{Intelligent Method of Bandwidth Distribution}
    % A heuristic based router that intelligently allocates bandwidth to hosts
    % Based on the behavior of uploads and downloads

\section{Implementation Methodology}
    % Want to classify each host's current upload/download usage
        % Use 
    % Use this classification to create priority tiers that influence how users get more bandwidth/bandwidth taken away
        % What is the rationale behind these priorities (study on what types of behaviors use what types of bandwidth)
    % Create these modifications to move bandwidth caps up and down via pfSense limiters


\section{Why was it implemented this way?}
    % Heuristic behavior was selected over a machine learning model
        % Why?
    % Privacy concerns
        % Did not want to classify based on the traffic type and what the user was doing
        % To create a fair algorithm can not define one type of traffic as "more important"
            % Is a Zoom call more important than a Netflix stream?
            % Business vs. Pleasure BUT Zoom is not always business and Netflix is not always leisure
    % Designed to be more system agnostic (tested on a pfSense Router)

\section{Program Effectiveness}
    % Only one iteration was able to be performed
    % Not enough traffic/users on the network for meaningful data
        % At no point during any test was total network utilization above 50%, can't take bandwidth from users to give to others if there is always a pool
    % Ways to modify/fix the experiment and test environment to create a meaningful test
