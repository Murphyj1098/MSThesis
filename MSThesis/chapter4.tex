\chapter{Intelligent Router}
\label{chapter4}

    % Broadband in rural situations is limited due to reasons explained in Chapter 3
    % In addition to creating and testing new topologies, other methods can be used to maximize the deliverable bandwidth
    % In this case, giving users bandwidth in an intelligent manner can allow the network to perform better
    % Utilizes the OVERCOME test-bed from Chapter 3

\section{Intelligent Method of Bandwidth Distribution}
    % A heuristic based router that intelligently allocates bandwidth to hosts
    % Based on the behavior of uploads and downloads


\section{Implementation Methodology}
    % (FIGURE\_classify+allocate\_flowcharts)
    % Want to classify each host's current upload/download usage
        % Used tool: iftop to get average usage over 2 seconds, record usage every 6 seconds (10 times per minute)
        % (FIGURE\_iftop)
    % Use this classification to create priority tiers that influence how users get more bandwidth/bandwidth taken away
        % What is the rationale behind these priorities (study on what types of behaviors use what types of bandwidth)
    % Create these modifications to move bandwidth caps up and down via pfSense limiters


\section{Why was it implemented this way?}
    % Heuristic behavior was selected over a machine learning model
        % Why?
    % System privacy concerns
        % Did not want to classify based on the traffic type and what the user was doing
        % To create a fair algorithm can not define one type of traffic as "more important"
            % Is a Zoom call more important than a Netflix stream?
            % Business vs. Pleasure BUT Zoom is not always business and Netflix is not always leisure
    % Designed to be more system agnostic (tested on a pfSense Router)
        % Utilizes pfSense-specific limiters but the idea of setting a limit is very universal
        % Lighter weight than a ML algorithm likely would be, can be deployed closer to the last mile since it is lighter-weight

        
\section{Effectiveness of the Program}
    % Only deployed for an initial iteration due to network issues
        % No revisions made, only tested the most basic behavior
    % Not enough traffic/users on the network for meaningful data
        % At no point during any test was total network utilization above 50%, can't take bandwidth from users to give to others if there is always a pool
    % Ways to modify/fix the experiment and test environment to create a meaningful test
