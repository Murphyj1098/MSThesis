\chapter{Robot Swarm Networks}
\label{chapter5}

    % Overview of the swarm and swarm mission

\section{What was implemented?}
    % Details of the robot swarm
    % Introduce ARGoS
    % Combine EMANE and ARGoS for:
        % Better communication modeling
        % Ability to actually use the full implementation of BATMAN
        % Use ML to influence the swarm and network topologies

\section{How was it implemented?}
    % Two simulation/emulation programs run simultaneous on the same machines
    % Take turns running for a time delta (default 100ms)
    % Utilize shared system memory to pass data between processes

\section{Why was it implemented this way?}
    % Why integrate EMANE with ARGoS
    % Why make the abstractions made
        % Don't send actual data payload through EMANE, just inform on amount of data tx'ed
    % Why preserve the behavior that was preserved
        % Ensure locations are correct as it is essential for determining routes/pathloss/etc.
