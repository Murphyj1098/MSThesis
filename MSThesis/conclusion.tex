\section{Research Outcomes}
    % Displayed that EMANE is a useful tool in network testing for a variety of reasons

\section{Future Work}
    % Create more accurate and refined models for EMANE that can then be pluggable into testbeds
        % Once these models are created, more advance wireless emulation can be done with similar ease thanks to the plug and play nature of EMANE
        % These models would will need to be vigorously tested to ensure the validity of the results
    % Further testing of the intelligent router program in more appropriate conditions
    % Further integrations between ARGoS and EMANE to expand functionality and optimize time consumed
