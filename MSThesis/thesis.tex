I would first and foremost like to thank Professor Alexander Wyglinski for all the advice and guidance he has provided me with, not only throughout this thesis and graduate degree, but also my entire senior year and capstone design project. Without his insights and advice, this project would not be complete.\par
I would like to thank Professor Carlo Pinciroli and Professor Bashima Islam for serving as my research committee members and providing me with feedback on my work.\par
Thank you to both the teams at US Ignite and the U.S. Army DEVCOM for supporting my graduate degree and providing me with the tools necessary to complete my research.\par
And lastly, a special thank you to all my friends and family for their endless support throughout my entire academic career.
